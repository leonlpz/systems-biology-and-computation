Knowing the complete genome of a given species is only one of the first pieces of the biological puzzle. To fully reveal the systematic functioning of an organism, an organ, or even a simple cell, we need to understand the dynamics of underlying genetic regulation. Given the complexity of the entire system, understanding the functioning of an organism is an unattainable goal at the moment. However,
we can analyze the simplest genetic systems, and thus develop the mathematical techniques necessary to study increasingly complex systems
